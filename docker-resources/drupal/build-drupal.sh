# Instead of running individual RUN commands in the Dockerfiles, we are using
# this technique because previously, we could make one image (dev) build
# FROM another, but this is no longer automatic in case of mixed platforms (m1,
# intel) without using FROM ... --platform = ..., which works on mac OS on m1,
# but not on CircleCI. Therefore, instead of making one image build FROM
# another, we are running this script in all images.
